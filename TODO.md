- Requirements
  - Business requirements - what application should do
    - Identify initial requirements
    - Work on details of initial requirements_
  - Technical requirements - technology stack (which framework / languages should we use)
    - Translation of business requirements into technical ones

### Notes application
    - Business requirements
        - storing and managing (add/edit) notes
        - adding extra stuff to notes
        - status - (new/in progress/done)
        - reminders about dates

### Steps for adding reservations (JSON)
